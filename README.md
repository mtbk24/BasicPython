# BasicPython
Contains Basic Python examples to reference.

This repository stores a large number of files containing basic python commands. I tried to separate them into folders based on the main focus of each file. Most are python notebooks. Many are disorganized since these are the files I created while learning various Python tools. Some are significantly more advanced than others. 
Some code segments were copied and pasted directly from a python blog, a stack exchange page, or typed from a text book. 

My intent is not to plagiarize code, but to have these examples easily accessable from anywhere. Over time I will work on cleaning up the contents of this repository.
